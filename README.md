## Docker

### Using Docker-Compose

Make sure to install the  `docker-compose` using your package manager on linux. It's installed by default on Windows and on Mac.
Make sure to edit the `docker-compose.yml` file and set your own variables there
```sh
    # screen
    # Optional : Using screen so that you can run the process in background , you may come out of screen using CTRL + A + D and join it back by typing screen -x
    sudo docker-compose up
```
### Docker build it yourself

```sh
    docker build . -t [image-name] 
    docker run -e OPENAI_API_KEY=<your key> [image-name]
```
## Usage

To use the bot, simply send a message with the `!gpt`/`!dalle` command followed by your prompt. For example:

GPT:
- `!gpt What is the meaning of life?`

DALLE:
- `!dalle A frog with a red hat is walking on a bridge.`

The bot only responds to messages that are received by you, not sent by you.

## Disable prefix

You can disable the `!gpt` prefix by setting `PREFIX_ENABLED` to `false` in the .env file.

If you disable the prefix, the bot will not support DALLE and only GPT will be used.

## Disclaimer
The operations performed by this bot are not free. You will be charged by OpenAI for each request you make.
